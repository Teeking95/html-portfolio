<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I'm 29 years old, originally from Munich, Germany, with Turkish roots, and I now call Amsterdam home.
  I’m passionate about staying active—I love running, doing CrossFit, and hiking whenever I can escape into nature. 
  Traveling is also a big part of my life; for me, it’s all about discovering new experiences and immersing myself in different cultures. 
  I’m always planning my next adventure, whether it’s exploring a new city or trekking through a remote landscape.

  Professionally, I’ve been working at adidas for over six years in IT Management, where I’ve developed a deep expertise as a Product Owner in the CRM space. 
  My role allows me to bridge technology and consumer engagement, which is incredibly rewarding. 
  In addition to my CRM work, I’ve had hands-on experience with front-end web development and backend engineering during my time at adidas, so I have a strong technical foundation to support my work.

  Right now, I’m diving into coding as part of a personal project. 
  This is my first coding endeavor, and I’m really excited to see where it takes me. 
  Learning to code is both challenging and fun, and it’s giving me new ways to approach problem-solving in my current job while helping me grow in new directions.
